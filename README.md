ABOUT:

  It is about a Car Service Managment System. To be more precise, vehicle inspection is a procedure mandated by national or subnational     governments in many countries, in which a vehicle is inspected to ensure that it conforms to regulations governing safety, emissions, or   both.

USERS: 

  The users that can enter the intranet system are the Administrator, a Secretary and an Engineer. The Administrator can only be created     from an sql query. The other two can be added from the UI.
  
  
SERVICES:

  By providing the data you want to store to the database, you can keep track of cars entering the system, their service status and the     date they have to come back for another inspection.
  In other words, the JAVA API that have has been set can:
      --> Return you a Client Object with all the information you keep through the UI.
      --> Returns a list of cars for each and every client of your database.
      --> Make an appointment with the Engineer for a typical vehicle inspection.
      --> Check if the car's plate exists in the National Car Database System.
